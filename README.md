# Digital Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal digital portfolio website.

The site serves as a living showcase of my projects, experience, and technical interests, while also acting as a sandbox for hands-on learning and experimentation with modern web development tools.

## Motivation

Traditional resumes often struggle to reflect the depth and evolution of real-world development work. This portfolio was built to present my experience in a more interactive and contextual format, while allowing continuous iteration as my skills grow.

## Tech Stack

- React  
- Next.js  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Vercel  

## Development

This project uses standard Next.js development workflows.

Install dependencies:
```bash
    npm install
```
Start the development server:
```bash
    npm run dev
```
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Deployment

The site is deployed using Vercel. Commits to the main branch automatically trigger a new deployment.

## Notes

This project is actively maintained and evolves as new projects, ideas, and technologies are explored.
